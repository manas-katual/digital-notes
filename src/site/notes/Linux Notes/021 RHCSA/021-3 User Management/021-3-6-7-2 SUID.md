# SUID

## Applicable on commands only

- By default, when a user executes a command, the command runs with that user's authority
- If user is authorized to perform the task, then command will run successfully
- If user is not authorised to perform the task, then command will not run successfully
- But, if we want that if any user runs a command it should always use root's authorization to perform task, then we can apply SUID permission on the command
- Which command is used to identify a commands absolute path
- `chmod u+s /path` is used to apply SUID
- `chmod u-s /path` is used to remove SUID

### Type of privileges escalation :
- problem : It is special permission. Hence, it is globally applied.
- solution : SUDO
- SUDO - Super User DOer
- It is not a permission
- It is a configuration that allows to run commands with root's power but in a controlled manner
- We can escalate privilege for individual user and group.

### Steps :
1. root has to escalate privileges for users and groups
2. local users will have to sudo power to run commands.

- visudo command is used for privilege escalation by root
- local user should run commands with sudo command.
