**. dot**  &rarr; it represents current directory
**.. double dot** &rarr; it represents previous directory
**~ tilda** &rarr; it represents user's home directory

- In Linux if we want to change our directory we start from **"/"** 
- for e.g. If we want to go to conf directory the command will be "/etc/httpd/conf" (refer to above diagram)
- If we are in a directory (etc) and we want to go to totally different directory (sbin) then we have to give its absolute path e.g. "cd /usr/local/sbin"
- if we want to go to previous directory (one step back) the command will be "cd .." if we want to go 2 step back then it will be "cd ../.."

- root user (home directory) :-
	/root/Desktop
	OR
	/~/Desktop

If we want to go to our home directory we simply press ~(Tilda) symbol in keyboard (This doesn't worked for me)
