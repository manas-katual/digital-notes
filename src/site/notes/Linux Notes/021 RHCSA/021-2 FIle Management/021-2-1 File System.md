# Linux File System

  
1. **/** →
    - It is the root directory of Linux file system. It is the mount point of the system partition. All other files & directories are always **"/"** directory.
    - In Linux everything starts with **"/"** directory and end in **"/"** directory.
2. **/boot** →
{ #3f0f81}

    - It contains all the boot files required to start the OS.
    - When we power on the server OS cannot start automatically.
    - OS cannot start automatically no matter what.
    - First the boot files are loaded and after that the operating system boots.
    - It is advisable not to do anything with **/boot** file or store any private data unless we are given task
3. **/dev** →
{ #3a09c4}

    - It contains all the device driver files needed by hardware devices. The OS cannot use hardware devices. The OS cannot use hardware directly. Device driver is a link between the OS and hardware.
    - Every OS cannot directly talk to the devices like mouse, keyboard, Network, cd-rom, Hard drive it needs device drivers.
    - First OS
4. **/lib** &rarr;
{ #8accbb}

	- It contains all the library files. They are known as kernel modules in Linux. File extension of kernel modules are ".ko" ".so"
	- In every OS there are 2 space kernel space & user space "/lib" is the kernel space and every other directories are user space
	- In Linux we have a dedicated directory for kernel it is called /lib
5. **/usr** &rarr;
{ #2a7a7d}

	- It contains all the commands and some optional config files.
	- Commands in Linux are of 2 types.
	- BIN (binary) - binaries stored in /usr/bin, can be used by all users
	- SBIN (superbinary) - binaries stored in /usr/sbin, can only be used by root
	- /usr doesn't contain files directly it contains sub directories 
	- User will give the command through shell to the user space and then it will search the commands in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin and it will pass the message to kernel space. Execution will happen at the kernel space and it will then show the output/error to the user space
