# Remote Services

- Remote services help admins and developers to access server remotely over an IP network
- Since Linux server run on command line, admins and developers take CLI remote access of servers for administration and application development purpose
- There are plenty of opensource tools on Linux for CLI remote access like telnet, RSH, rlogin and SSH
- Telnet was the 1st ever remote service that existed. But due to it's unsecured behavior, it is not preferred nowadays
- SSH is the most preferred remote service, as it is most secured
