- Linux is case sensitive
- e.g. If we create ABC and we create abc it will be both different file or directory
- Linux is space sensitive
- spaces are not allowed in Linux while creating a file/folder
- There is no concept of file extensions in Linux
- e.g. (.mp3, .txt, .pdf)
- `file` command is used to know file type or format
